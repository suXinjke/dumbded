# **What the hell is this?**

**dumbded** is a joke Win32 application that my friend asked to make for him. If you run **dumbded**, a randomly sized picture of **ded** will appear at random location for a few seconds, only to reappear some time later. **ded** also occupies system tray and can be eliminated only by using the task manager.

# **History of dumbded**

While I was venting programming problems to a friend of mine, he's given me a very specific request: *"can you make me the same shit but it would appear randomly and the pic has to be this"*

The idea was dumb as hell, but why not, it's an opportunity to do some pure WinAPI programming, so I went along.

My friend said if I actually make this, he'll be running **dumbded** ***FOR THREE MONTHS.***

# **dumbded lore**

I don't know who is this person, but what matters is that my friend's been watching and streaming The International finals in Discord call, and during the climax with Team Spirit losing to 2-2, he's put picture of this man on stream, and Team Spirit won afterwards. This **ded** carried the team to victory, so my friend is very fond of him.

**ded** (*дед*) is actually russian for *"old man*"
